        <h2>Mr. Balaram Sir</h2>
        <p>It is with mixed emotions that we bid farewell to our beloved Principal, Mr. Balaram Sir, as he takes on a new role at another school. During his time at TG Model School, he has brought an incredible amount of energy, innovation, and positive change. He was more than just a Principal to us; he was a mentor and a friend who always listened, supported, and encouraged us to strive for the best. His approachable nature and genuine concern for each student and staff member have made a lasting impact on our school community.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Under his leadership, TG Model School has seen remarkable growth and development. He has nurtured a spirit of collaboration and mutual respect among everyone, making the school a place where both learning and personal growth are valued. His vision and hard work have raised the standards of our institution and created a nurturing environment where students can flourish. His departure leaves a void that will be hard to fill, but the legacy he leaves behind will continue to guide and inspire us.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As he moves forward in his journey, we are filled with both sadness and gratitude. We will miss his presence deeply, but we know that his future school is incredibly fortunate to have such a dedicated and passionate leader. We wish him all the best in his new role and hope that he continues to make a positive difference in the lives of many more students and educators, just as he did here with us. His time at TG Model School will always be cherished, and he will forever hold a special place in our hearts. </p><p style="color: blue;"><br><br><b>
